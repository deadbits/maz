# Malware Analysis Zoo

## Description
MAZ, short of Malware Analysis Zoo, is a Ruby based application for performing static malware analysis, and submitting samples and gathering the reports from 3rd party analysis services. The raw samples and all metadata and IOCs are stored within a local (or remote) MongoDB.   
Full documentation, license details and otherr information is available in the `docs` directory.

## Important Update 
This project has not been updated in a long time and is considered deprecated. There is a Python re-write in the works originally slated for April 2016, but life happens. So many projects, so little time :) 
* The new version is currently a private repo at https://github.com/deadbits/mazpy. 
  * _If you are interested in contributing in development or would like to be a beta-tester, please reach out!_

In the meantime, I recommend checking out projects like [stoQ](http://stoq.punchcyber.com/), [Viper](https://www.viper.li), [Aleph](https://github.com/trendmicro/aleph), and [Polichombr](https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/polichombr).
